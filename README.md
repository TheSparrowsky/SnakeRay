# üêç SnakeRay (Snake Game | C++ & raylib)
An educational implementation of the classic Snake game, developed in C++ using the raylib library. This project was created for learning purposes focusing on C++ programming and game architecture.


# Features
+ **Main menu:** AN intuitive main menu allowing players to start the game and view scoreboard.  
![Main menu image](.media/mainmenu.png)
+ **Difficulty levels:** Three difficulty levels - Easy, Medium, and Hard - affecting the size of the game board.
